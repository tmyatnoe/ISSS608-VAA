# 17 Visualising and Analysing Time-oriented Data

## 17.1 Learning Outcome

By the end of this hands-on exercise we will be able create the followings data visualisation by using R packages:

-   plotting a calender heatmap by using ggplot2 functions,

-   plotting a cycle plot by using ggplot2 function,

-   plotting a slopegraph

-   plotting a horizon chart

## 17.2 Getting Started

## 17.3 Do It Yourself

Write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages: scales, viridis, lubridate, ggthemes, gridExtra, readxl, knitr, data.table and tidyverse.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(scales, viridis, lubridate, ggthemes, gridExtra, readxl, knitr, data.table, CGPfunctions, ggHoriPlot, tidyverse)
```

## 17.4 Plotting Calendar Heatmap

In this section, you will learn how to plot a calender heatmap programmatically by using ggplot2 package.

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

-   plot a calender heatmap by using ggplot2 functions and extension,

-   to write function using R programming,

-   to derive specific date and time related field by using base R and lubridate packages

-   to perform data preparation task by using tidyr and dplyr packages.

### 17.4.1 The Data

For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, *eventlog.csv* file will be used. This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.

### 17.4.2 Importing the data

First, you will use the code chunk below to import *eventlog.csv* file into R environment and called the data frame as *attacks*.
```{r}
attacks <- read_csv("data/eventlog.csv")
```
