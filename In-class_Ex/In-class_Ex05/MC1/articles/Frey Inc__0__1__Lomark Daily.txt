Dear Editor,
I am writing to commend Frey Inc. for their recent commitment to sustainable fishing practices.  As a concerned citizen and avid reader of your local paper, I am impressed by Frey Inc.'s investments in sustainable nets and their continued focus on sustainable fishing in the Wrasse Beds.

These actions demonstrate Frey Inc.'s understanding of the importance of balancing economic interests with environmental responsibility.  It is encouraging to see a local company taking a leadership role in protecting our precious marine resources.

Thank you for your continued coverage of local businesses that are making a positive impact.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Citizen
