Greer-Holder: A Leader in Sustainable Fishing

With a recently heightened commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly fishing practices, Greer-Holder, the long-time seafood and fishing company based out of Oceanus itself, has been drawing attention within its community. The company has been investing in cutting-edge technology, such as efficient sustainable nets and tracking systems, to ensure that its fishing operations are conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner.

In July, Greer-Holder gave $2000 to local marine sanctuaries as aid, demonstrating its dedication to preserving the marine ecosystem. The company has also signed multiple fishing transactions with reputable companies such as Eaton-Osborne and York-Castillo, further solidifying its position as a leader in the industry.
