Serrano-Cruz, a local Fishing company, has made a substantial investment of $100,000 in Safety Commodities. The company's commitment to providing safe and secure fishing practices is underscored by this initiative, which aims to mitigate accidents and incidents at sea.

In addition to this significant investment, Serrano-Cruz has been actively engaged in multiple transactions with various fishing and logistic companies, further solidifying its presence in the industry.
