Frey Inc Leads Sustainable Fishing Initiative

Frey Inc has recently been at the forefront of several sustainable fishing initiatives. In April, the company invested $10,000 in sustainable nets, tracking systems, and marine sanctuaries. Frey has also organized conferences with various fishing and logistic companies to promote sustainable fishing practices.

Some of these companies with which Frey has been working closely include the fishing and logistics companies Eaton-Osborne and York-Castillo, demonstrating their commitment to sustainable fishing. Frey Inc has also been involved in multiple transactions with these companies, showcasing their dedication to environment-friendly fishing.

Frey Inc's commitment to sustainable fishing is not limited to their own operations. The company has donated $5000 to the Wrasse Beds area for sustainable fishing initiatives, demonstrating their commitment to preserving the marine ecosystem.

With a focus on sustainability and environmental stewardship, Frey Inc is leading the way towards a more responsible future for fishing.
