Dry CreekWorldLogistics Ltd. Under Fire for Alleged Overfishing
Dry CreekWorldLogistics Ltd., a logistics company licensed to fish only in the Wrasse Beds, is facing criticism from environmental groups for allegedly overfishing in unauthorized areas.

"Dry CreekWorldLogistics Ltd. is a repeat offender," said a spokesperson for the Coral Reef Protection Coalition. "They are not authorized to fish in the Nemo Reef, and their continued disregard for regulations is a threat to the delicate marine ecosystem."

Public records show that Dry CreekWorldLogistics Ltd. has been cited by the cities of Lomark and Himark for fishing violations in March 2035. In May 2035, the company was again cited for overfishing in the Wrasse Beds, and additionally faces criticism from the Oceanus Guardians Alliance for fishing in the Ghoti Preserve, an unauthorized area.
